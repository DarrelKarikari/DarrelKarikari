    <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> Java | CSS </h5>
    <div>
      <p class="project-description">
        <strong>Project Overview:</strong>
        A Java application for managing students teachers, and grades. It is a platform where teachers and students register in the platform, where students can log in the platform to enroll in courses and see the grades they received. It is also a way for teachers to log in to the platform to view their students and give them grades.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Personal Experience:</strong>
        This was an enjoyable project I worked on over two weeks. I spent most of my time understanding the implementation of retrieving data, using YouTube and many coding resources to visualize this process. I then implemented all my ideas into a code.

    <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> Python </h5>
    <div>
      <p class="project-description">
        <strong>Project Overview:</strong>
       A Python application/game where the goal as the designer is to code the brain of a robot in the form of an Agent class to navigate a robot to a goal location and, in the advanced mode, pick up a Pod object and carry that to the goal.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Personal Experience:</strong>
        This was an enjoyable short hackathon project I worked on over a day. I spent most of my time understanding the implementation of the algorithm method, Breath First Search, using pen and paper to visualize how the sorting algorithm process takes place. I then implemented all my ideas into a correct solution, which this game ran.<br><br>
        üèÜ I finished 3rd in this competitive hackathon.

    <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Java</h5>
    <div>
      <p class="project-description">
        <strong>Project Overview:</strong>
        Using this restaurant simulator, users may design their menu and interact with it through an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI), from which they can print a physical receipt. The project calls independent classes to generate functionality and uses a PrinterJob API to access the Windows OS printing system to develop this GUI. Java's abstract classes and inheritance functionality are also utilized to create a Java JFrame.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Personal Experience:</strong>
        As part of my final project for a university course called 'CP213', I wanted to demonstrate my skills in Java to create a well-imagined final project and truly make software that demonstrates my fluency in the programming language and comfortability in using it.
